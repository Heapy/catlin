# Rekoncile

**Ambitious and crazy**

Let's leverage Kotlin coroutines, DSL and multiplatform to build UI which can be rendered on server and browser, mobile or even terminal.

1. User interface as function of state: `UI = f(STATE)`;
2. Async and pull-based (Thanks Kotlin Coroutines);
3. Common parts can be shared between platforms: Web(DOM), Desktop(JavaFX, Qt, GTK), Android, iOS (Thanks Kotlin Multiplatform);
4. Built-in routing.

Let's create whole new world!
